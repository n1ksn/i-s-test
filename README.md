### Predicates for inglenook sidings puzzle that are used to find a solution for all standard staring conditions.

- There are 8! = 40320 standard starting conditions for the full version. The solutions were calculated 1000 at a time using yap.  Yap (Yet Another Prolog) was used because it is faster than SWI Prolog and gprolog.  The number of moves needed for each start are shown in the spreadsheet full-solutions.ods.

- For the small version, predicates generated all standard starting conditions in one run as there are only 5! = 120.  The number of moves needed are shown in small-solutions.ods.
